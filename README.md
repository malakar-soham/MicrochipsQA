# MicrochipsQA
Predicting whether microchips from a fabrication plant passes quality assurance (QA). 

I have implemented logistic regression to predict whether microchips from a fabrication plant passes quality assurance (QA). During QA, each microchip goes through various tests to ensure it is functioning correctly. Supposing I have the test results for some microchips on two diï¬€erent tests. From these two tests, I would like to determine whether the microchips should be accepted or rejected. I have taken a [dataset](data.txt) of test results on past microchips, on which my logistic regression model is based on.
